// Below is an example of printing the remainder of 18/4 using modulo:
// console.log(18 % 4); 
console.log(14 % 3)
console.log(99 % 8)
console.log(11 % 3)


// For instance, the expression "5 mod 2" would evaluate to 1 because 5 divided by 2 leaves a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 1, while "9 mod 3" would evaluate to 0 because the division of 9 by 3 has a quotient of 3 and leaves a remainder of 0; there is nothing to subtract from 9 after multiplying 3 times 3
