# Let's start with the simplest aspect of control flow: comparators. There are six:
#
#    Equal to (==)
#    Not equal to (!=)
#    Less than (<)
#    Less than or equal to (<=)
#    Greater than (>)
#    Greater than or equal to (>=)
#
# Comparators check if a value is (or is not) equal to, greater than (or equal to), or less than (or equal to) another value.
